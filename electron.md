### Engines
Electron has the Rutherford engine, the world's first 3d printed rocket engine with an electric fuel pump. The booster carries 9 sea level engines, and the second stage carries one vacuum-optimized Rutherford engine.

### Reusability
Rocket Lab plans on making Electron a partially reusable vehicle by deploying a parachute and catching it with a helicopter.

### Launch Sites 
#### Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1
Launch Complex 1 is located on the MƒÅhia Peninsula in New Zealand. It is home to two pads, A and B. 
#### Wallops Flight Facility
