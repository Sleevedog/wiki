### Engines
#### Booster
The Falcon 9 booster uses nine SpaceX Merlin engines hence the name Falcon 9. 
At sea level, they provide a combined thrust of 7,607 kN / 1,710,000 lbf and in a vacuum, they are able to provide 8,227 kN / 1,849,500 lbf of thrust. 
They're used for the initial take-off and flight of the rocket until booster separation. After stage separation, the engines are used to flip the booster back around and land.

#### Second Stage
The second stage uses a single Merlin Vacuum Engine. This engine is optimized for Vacuum use and is able to provide 981 kN / 220,500 lbf of thrust in a vacuum. 
The engine is used to push the payload into orbit and orbital adjustments thereafter.

### Launch Sites and Pads
#### Kennedy Space Center (KSC)
SpaceX operates two pads for Falcon 9 at KSC. They currently rent historic launch complex 39-A from NASA and lease SLC-40 from the Space Force. SpaceX uses LC-39A for Crew Dragon launches, internal Starlink launches, and commercial launches.
SLC-40 is where SpaceX launches national security payloads, Starlink, as well as commercial payloads. Both pads formerly launched the now retired dragon spacecraft

#### Vandenburg Space Force Base
Vandenburg host one SpaceX pad SLC-4E. They are currently leasing this pad from the Space Force. 
This pad sees less use than either LC-39A or SLC40 but nevertheless provides an invaluable service to SpaceX. 
This is the only pad SpaceX currently utilizes that can support polar orbit launches. SpaceX almost exclusively uses this pad for the aforementioned polar launches.

#### Landing Pads
SpaceX operates three landing pads. LZ-1 and LZ-2 at KSC and LZ-4 at vandeburg
