### Overview
The Raptor engine is a full-flow staged-combustion engine built by SpaceX for [Starship](/wiki/starship). The engine uses Liquid Oxygen (LOx) as the oxidizer and Liquid Methane (CH4) as the fuel. The first version of Raptor, Raptor 1, has a thrust of around 150 tons, while Raptor 2 has a thrust of 230 to 250 tons, while at the same time reducing the cost of production and complexity of the design. Each version has of Raptor has 3 variants, Raptor Center, Raptor Boost, and Raptor Vacuum. At this time, Raptor is the only full-flow staged-combustion engine to ever fly.
